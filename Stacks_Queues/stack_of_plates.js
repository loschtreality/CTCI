// Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high,
// it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start
// a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement
// a data structre SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
// composed of several stacks and should create anew stac once the previous
// once exceeds capaciy. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave
// identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values
// as if there were just a single stack)

// Follow up:
// Implement a funciton popAt(index) which performs a pop operation on a
// specific sub-stack
