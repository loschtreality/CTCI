// An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats operates strictly on
// a "first in first out" basis. People must adopt either the oldest
// (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select
// weather they would prefer a dog or cat (and will receive the oldest animal of
// that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create
// the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as
// enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, dequeueCat. You may use the built-in
// LinkedList data structure
